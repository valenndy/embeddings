# Semantic Search and Clustering with Embeddings

This notebook explores how **text embeddings** can be used to perform **semantic search** and **text clustering**, allowing machines to understand and organize information based on meaning rather than just keywords.

## What are Embeddings?

**Embeddings** are numerical representations of text that capture its semantic meaning in a high-dimensional vector space.  
Unlike traditional keyword-based methods, embeddings allow computers to measure **semantic similarity** — that is, how close two pieces of text are in meaning — even when they use different words.

For example, the sentences:

> “AI helps automate processes”  
> “Artificial intelligence streamlines tasks”

have similar meanings and therefore will have **embedding vectors close to each other** in this space.

## What the Notebook Demonstrates

The notebook guides the reader through a practical example using embeddings to:
1. Generate vector representations for a small set of sample texts.  
2. Perform **semantic search**, finding documents that best match a query based on cosine similarity.  
3. Apply **K-Means clustering** to group related texts into meaningful clusters.  
4. Visualize clusters in 2D using PCA for easier interpretation.  
5. Identify the **most representative document (medoid)** of each cluster.

Each step includes clear explanations and a small **challenge for the audience**, encouraging experimentation and understanding of how embeddings behave.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, the reader will:
- Understand how embeddings encode semantic meaning.  
- Be able to apply embeddings for both **search** and **clustering** tasks.  
- Visualize and interpret clusters to uncover hidden relationships in text data.  
- Experiment hands-on with similarity metrics and clustering parameters.

## Tools Used

- **Python** 
- **Sentence Transformers** for generating embeddings  
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering and dimensionality reduction  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization  

---

## Challenge

At the end of the notebook, a short interactive challenge invites the audience to:
- Complete a function to identify the *most representative* document in each cluster.  
- Analyze and interpret which texts best represent each group.  

This challenge reinforces the key concept that embeddings allow machines to group ideas based on **meaning**, not just words.

---

## Conclusion

This notebook offers a hands-on, intuitive introduction to embeddings and their applications in semantic understanding.  
It’s an excellent starting point for anyone interested in **natural language processing**, **AI-powered search**, or **text analytics**.
